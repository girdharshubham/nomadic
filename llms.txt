# nomadic - Travel Journal Companion Agent
# LLMs.txt - Describes intended LLM-enabled functionality and agentic behaviors.

## Agent Role
Nomadic is a personal travel journal companion. It helps the user:
- Log travels and daily experiences
- Reflect on meaningful moments
- Track expenses
- Summarize journeys and costs
- Recommend entries or places to revisit
- Ask reflective or planning questions

## Agent Abilities (Planned with LLMs)
- Summarize journal entries (daily, per trip, per location)
- Suggest reflective prompts (e.g., “What made today special?”)
- Extract sentiment and highlights from entries
- Recommend places based on past enjoyment
- Parse and tag entries with metadata: {location, emotion, people, events}
- Generate summaries like “Your year in travel”
- Expense insights: cost breakdown by category, trip, country, day
- Identify anomalies (“Why did you spend so much on Day 3?”)
- Answer financial queries (“How much did I spend on food in Spain?”)

## Agent Memory (Current State)
- In-memory store of trips and entries

### Data Model:
- **Trip**: {title, location(s), start/end dates, entries, expenses}
- **Entry**: {timestamp, text}
- **Expense**: {timestamp, amount, currency, category, description}

## Agentic Behavior (Initial CLI version)
- Record trip: `nomadic new-trip`
- Add journal entry: `nomadic add-entry`
- Add expense: `nomadic add-expense`
- List trips: `nomadic list`
- Show trip summary: `nomadic show-trip`
- Show expenses: `nomadic show-expenses`
- Export journal or expenses (future): `nomadic export`

## Future Evolution
- Use LLMs to analyze and summarize journal & expense patterns
- Natural language queries on expenses (e.g., “How much did Bali cost me?”)
- Sync across devices, with iPad-first UX
