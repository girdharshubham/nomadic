## Implementation Notes

1. **Variable Substitution**: All variables in double curly braces `{{variable}}` should be replaced with actual data before sending to the LLM.

2. **Context Management**: For longer entries or trips, implement a strategy to handle token limits:
   - Summarize longer entries before including them in prompts
   - Select representative samples when full inclusion isn't possible
   - Use chunking strategies for processing large datasets

3. **Prompt Refinement**: These prompts should be continuously refined based on:
   - User feedback
   - Quality of LLM responses
   - Changes in LLM capabilities
   - Specific edge cases encountered

4. **Fallback Strategies**: Implement fallbacks for when:
   - The LLM response doesn't match expected format
   - The response quality is poor
   - The LLM service is unavailable

5. **Privacy Considerations**: 
   - Ensure prompts don't leak sensitive information
   - Consider local LLM options for privacy-sensitive users
   - Implement data minimization in prompts
