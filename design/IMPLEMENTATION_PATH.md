# Nomadic - Implementation Path

This document outlines the implementation strategy for Nomadic, a travel journal companion agent TUI built in Go with LLM capabilities.

## Phase 1: Core TUI Application (Foundation)

### 1.1 Project Setup
- Initialize Go module and project structure
- Set up TUI framework using Bubbletea and Lipgloss
- Implement basic configuration management
- Create data persistence layer (initially file-based JSON storage)

### 1.2 Data Models Implementation
- Implement core data models:
  - Trip: {title, location(s), start/end dates, entries, expenses}
  - Entry: {timestamp, text}
  - Expense: {timestamp, amount, currency, category, description}
- Add validation and serialization/deserialization

### 1.3 Basic TUI Views and Interactions
- Implement essential TUI screens and interactions:
  - Main menu with navigation options
  - Trip creation view with metadata input
  - Journal entry creation and editing view
  - Expense recording interface with categories
  - Trip listing and selection view
  - Trip details view with entries
  - Expense breakdown and visualization

### 1.4 Testing & Documentation
- Write unit tests for core functionality
- Create user documentation for TUI navigation and interactions
- Add example workflows and usage scenarios

## Phase 2: LLM Integration (Basic Features)

### 2.1 LLM Service Integration
- Set up LLM API client (OpenAI, Anthropic, or local models)
- Implement prompt templates for different use cases
- Create abstraction layer for LLM interactions

### 2.2 Basic LLM Features
- Implement entry summarization (daily, per trip)
- Add reflective prompt suggestions
- Create sentiment analysis for entries
- Build metadata extraction and tagging system

### 2.3 Enhanced TUI Features
- Summarization view: Generate and display summaries of entries
- Reflection interface: Present reflective prompts based on past entries
- Analysis dashboard: Show sentiment analysis and highlights from entries

### 2.4 Testing & Refinement
- Test LLM features with various inputs
- Refine prompts for better results
- Optimize token usage

## Phase 3: Advanced Features & Expense Analysis

### 3.1 Expense Analytics
- Implement expense categorization and analysis
- Add currency conversion capabilities
- Create expense insights and reporting

### 3.2 Advanced LLM Features
- Implement place recommendations based on sentiment analysis
- Add anomaly detection in expenses
- Create "Year in Travel" summary generation

### 3.3 Natural Language Queries
- Build a simple NL query parser for expenses
- Implement query-to-structured-data conversion
- Create response formatting for natural language answers

### 3.4 Advanced TUI Features
- Natural language query interface: Answer questions about expenses
- Insights dashboard: Display expense insights and anomalies
- Recommendation panel: Show suggestions based on past entries

## Phase 4: Persistence & Synchronization

### 4.1 Improved Data Storage
- Migrate from file-based to database storage (SQLite initially)
- Implement data migration tools
- Add data backup and restore functionality

### 4.2 Export Capabilities
- Add export to various formats (PDF, Markdown, CSV for expenses)
- Implement templating for customized exports
- Create visualization options for expenses

### 4.3 Synchronization Framework
- Design cloud synchronization architecture
- Implement secure data sync with conflict resolution
- Add multi-device support foundation

## Phase 5: UI & Platform Expansion

### 5.1 Web Interface
- Create a simple web UI for viewing and editing
- Implement responsive design for mobile and tablet
- Add visualization components for expenses

### 5.2 iPad-First Experience
- Design and implement iPad-optimized interface
- Add touch-friendly interactions
- Implement offline capabilities with sync

### 5.3 Ecosystem Integration
- Add calendar integration for trip planning
- Implement location services integration
- Create photo/media attachment capabilities

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture
- Use a clean architecture approach with clear separation of concerns
- Implement domain-driven design for core entities
- Create abstraction layers for external services (LLMs, storage)

### LLM Strategy
- Use a combination of few-shot prompting and fine-tuning
- Implement caching to reduce API costs
- Create fallbacks for offline operation

### Security & Privacy
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Implement proper authentication for sync
- Ensure user data privacy with local-first approach

### Performance
- Optimize LLM token usage
- Implement efficient data storage and retrieval
- Ensure responsive TUI experience even with large datasets

## Development Roadmap Timeline

1. **Month 1-2**: Phase 1 - Core TUI Application
