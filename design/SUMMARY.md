# Nomadic - Project Summary

## Overview

Nomadic is a travel journal companion agent designed to help users log travels, reflect on experiences, track expenses, and gain insights from their journeys. This document summarizes the work completed to analyze the product goals and design an implementation path for the project.

## Completed Work

### 1. Product Goals Analysis

We analyzed the product goals from the `llms.txt` file, which outlined:

- **Agent Role**: A personal travel journal companion for logging travels, reflecting on moments, tracking expenses, and summarizing journeys.
- **LLM-Enabled Features**: Capabilities like summarizing entries, suggesting reflective prompts, extracting sentiment, recommending places, and providing expense insights.
- **Data Model**: Structure for trips, entries, and expenses.
- **TUI Interface**: Interactive terminal user interface using Bubbletea for interacting with the journal.
- **Future Evolution**: Plans for more advanced LLM analysis, natural language queries, and cross-device synchronization.

### 2. Implementation Path

We designed a phased implementation approach:

- **Phase 1**: Core TUI application with basic trip, entry, and expense management.
- **Phase 2**: Basic LLM integration for summarization and reflection.
- **Phase 3**: Advanced features including expense analysis and place recommendations.
- **Phase 4**: Improved persistence and synchronization capabilities.
- **Phase 5**: UI expansion with web and mobile interfaces.

The implementation path includes a timeline and initial milestones to guide development.

### 3. Project Structure

We proposed a Go-based project structure following best practices:

- **Terminal User Interface**: Using Bubbletea and Lipgloss for an interactive TUI.
- **Core Services**: Modular design for trip, entry, and expense management.
- **Data Models**: Well-defined structures for the application's domain.
- **Storage Layer**: Interface-based approach for data persistence.
- **LLM Integration**: Abstraction layer for working with language models.

The structure emphasizes clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns.

### 4. LLM Prompt Templates

We designed comprehensive prompt templates for various LLM-powered features:

- **Entry Summarization**: Templates for daily, trip, and location summaries.
- **Reflective Prompts**: Templates for generating thoughtful questions.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Templates for extracting emotions and metadata.
- **Place Recommendations**: Templates for suggesting new places to visit.
- **Expense Analysis**: Templates for providing insights on spending patterns.
- **Natural Language Queries**: Templates for processing and responding to queries.

Each template includes clear instructions, context variables, and formatting guidelines.

### 5. Sample Implementation

We created a sample implementation of the entry summarization feature:

- **Data Models**: Structures for journal entries.
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI API client for generating summaries.
- **Prompt Management**: Template-based approach for generating prompts.
- **Error Handling**: Robust handling of API errors and edge cases.

The sample demonstrates how the LLM integration works in practice with real journal entries.

### 6. Testing Strategy

We developed a comprehensive testing strategy for LLM-powered features:

- **Unit Testing**: Approaches for testing prompt templates and mock LLM clients.
- **Integration Testing**: Methods for testing with actual LLM APIs.
- **Snapshot Testing**: Comparing outputs against "golden" responses.
- **Semantic Testing**: Validating semantic properties rather than exact matches.
- **Property-Based Testing**: Ensuring outputs meet defined properties.
- **User Evaluation**: Framework for human evaluation of LLM outputs.

The strategy addresses the unique challenges of testing non-deterministic LLM outputs.

### 7. Architecture and Integration

We documented the overall architecture and integration approach:

- **System Architecture**: High-level design of the application components.
- **Component Design**: Detailed design of each major component.
- **Integration Patterns**: Patterns for LLM integration and data flow.
- **Error Handling**: Strategies for handling LLM service failures.
- **Performance Optimization**: Approaches for optimizing token usage and response times.
- **Security Considerations**: Handling of API keys and user data privacy.
- **Future Evolution**: Paths for expanding the application beyond the initial implementation.

The architecture provides a solid foundation for building a reliable, extensible application.

## Next Steps

To move forward with the Nomadic project, the following steps are recommended:

1. **Initialize the Go Project**: Set up the basic project structure and dependencies.
2. **Implement Core Data Models**: Build the foundational data structures.
3. **Create the Storage Layer**: Implement the JSON-based storage system.
4. **Build Basic TUI**: Develop the essential terminal user interface with Bubbletea.
5. **Integrate LLM Capabilities**: Start with the entry summarization feature.
6. **Implement Testing Framework**: Set up the testing infrastructure.
7. **Add More LLM Features**: Progressively implement additional capabilities.
8. **Refine User Experience**: Improve the TUI based on feedback.
9. **Optimize Performance**: Enhance response times and reduce token usage.
10. **Prepare for Distribution**: Create installation packages and documentation.

## Conclusion

The Nomadic project has a clear vision and well-defined path forward. The design emphasizes:

- **User-Centric**: Focused on enhancing the travel journaling experience.
- **Privacy-First**: Respecting user data with local-first approach.
- **LLM-Enhanced**: Leveraging language models to provide valuable insights.
- **Extensible**: Designed for future growth and additional capabilities.
- **Well-Structured**: Following software engineering best practices.

With the foundation laid out in these documents, the Nomadic travel journal companion is well-positioned for successful implementation and future evolution.
